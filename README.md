# Welcome to my Page

This is a simple page, playing arround with github...
You can ither read it or you can leave and forget about it! :)

## What am I doing here?

Unfortunately not much.

I've got a small [repository](https://github.com/andreaskou/PHPBB_IUM), a small extention for [PHPBB](https://www.phpbb.com).
And a second one that is just for recriational reasons 


### Let's talk about the first repo...

As I mentioned before this is a simple phpbb extention, what it does is also simple.
It sends reminders to users that don't come back after a while or to users that have registered but never visited the phpbb board.
There are several options to choose from.

Such as...

- The amount of days to consider a member as _inactive_.
- How many mails per day should the extensio send.
- In the e-mail reminder can also be included some links to top topics of the user (_if he had any_) and some of the top topics of the board.
- Two different templates. Depending on the members condition.
  - A riminder to users that have come back
  - A reminder for users that have never returned after registration.
- List to exclude forums that should not be included in the reminder.
- If user does not return there is an option of autodeletion (after set amount of days).
- Option for the user to selfdelete his acount
- Of course there is a list that for users that should be ignored.
