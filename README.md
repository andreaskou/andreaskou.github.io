# Welcome to my Page

This is a simple page, playing arround with github...
You can ither read it or you can leave and forget about it! :)

## What am I doing here?

Unfortunately not much.

I've got a small [repository](https://github.com/andreaskou/PHPBB_IUM), a small extention for [PHPBB](https://www.phpbb.com).
And a second one that is just for recriational reasons 


###Let's talk about the first repo...

As I mentioned before this is a simple phpbb extention, what it does is also simple.
It sends reminders to users that don't come back after a while or to users that have registered but never visited the phpbb board.
There are several options to choose from.

Such as...
- The amount of days to consider a member as _inactive_.
- How many mails per day should the extensio send.
- In the e-mail reminder can also be included some links to top topics of the user (_if he had any_) and some of the top topics of the board.


1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/andreaskou/andreaskou.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
